        <h2>
          Balance
        </h2>
        <p>
          The first way this panel conveys the principle of balance is because the background is lighter than the
          circles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second way this panel conveys the principle of balance is because the five circles are the same size and
          are equally spaced on the same arc within the panel.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Proportion
        </h2>
        <p>
          This panel conveys the principle of proportion because of the significant (2X) size difference between the two
          circles.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Rhythm
        </h2>
        <p>
          The first way this panel conveys the principle of rhythm is through progressive rhythm because each adjacent
          circle is smaller or larger than the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second way this panel conveys the principle of rhythm is through alternating rhythm because the four
          circles
          alternate between high and low contrast inner and outer circles.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Emphasis
        </h2>
        <p>
          The first way this panel conveys the principle of emphasis is through isolation because the emphasized circle
          is
          separated from the other three circles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second way this panel conveys the principle of emphasis is through contrast because the emphasized circle
          is
          darker in color than the other three circles.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Unity Through Repetition of Color
        </h2>
        <p>
          The first way the composition is unified is through the repetition of color.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is because each individual panel exhibits a monochromatic color scheme while the composition, as a whole,
          exhibits a tetradic color scheme.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Unity Through Repetition of Shape
        </h2>
        <p>
          The second way the composition is unified is through the repetition of shape.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first way the composition is unified through the repetition of shape is because the shapes within each
          individual panel are circular.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second way the composition is unified through the repetition of shape is because the shape of the
          composition, as a whole, is circular.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Unity Through Continuation
        </h2>
        <p>
          The third way the composition is unified is through continuation.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is because all of the circles connecting the individual panels are the same size, which helps lead the
          eyes
          from one panel to the next.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Unity Through Continuity
        </h2>
        <p>
          The fourth way the composition is unified is through continuity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first way the composition is unified through continuity is because when the panelsâ€™ individual circles are
          combined they form a circle. That is, all the individual circles are centered on a large circle.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second way the composition is unified through continuity is because the circles within the proportion and
          emphasis panels are mirrored within the rhythm and balance panels.
