        <h2>
          Design Principles: Composition
        </h2>
        <p>
          Scale and Proportion—the main design principle that I used in this composition was scale and proportion.
          First,
          I reduced the scale from 2 inches to 1 centimeter for the orthographic views and the trace layer. Then, once I
          completed production on the color, patina, and shadow layers, I scaled the perspective portion to 200%.
        </p>
        <p>
          Balance—the smaller orthographic views were balanced vs the larger perspective view by using the arrows and by
          using the gestalt principle of proximity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gestalt—the gestalt principles that I used were proximity and common region. The orthographic views were
          placed
          near each other (proximity) while the composition was placed within the black border (common region).
        </p>
        <h2>
          Design Principles: The Object
        </h2>
        <p>
          Unity—repetition of shape (rectangles) and color (brown and black).
        </p>
        <p>
          Scale and Proportion—the object itself is a scaled down representation of a bird house.
        </p>
        <p>
          Emphasis and Focal Point—the doorway is placed at the center of the front face.
        </p>
        <p>
          Balance—the doorway, windows, and stars are placed symmetrically on the front face.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rhythm and Motion—the patina gives the piece a sense of motion as it provides the eyes a break from the hard
          edges produced by the many rectangles.
